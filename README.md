# RecipeMaster

Finding authentic recipes from different places and cultures around the world can be hard sometimes. 
Oftentimes people will search the internet for great Chinese or Mexican cuisines that they could make at home, 
and they end up very disappointed when the food on their dinner table doesn’t taste as authentic as they’d like. 
To solve this issue, we created a website where people can share many recipes and others can rate the quality of the cuisine, 
with locals from the specific area the dish originated from having the option to rate its authenticity.

This web application is currently being hosted on GitHub(link) and is making use of the django framework with assistance from
HTML and Python programming languages. This file will be updated as the project is developed, rendered, hosted, and finished.
